 **Project Goals and Core Features:**
 
The primary objective of this project is to create a functional web application capable of analyzing the sentiment of customer reviews. 
The application is designed to be intuitive, allowing users to input text that simulates real-world customer feedback. Upon submission, the system processes this text to determine its underlying sentiment.

The core technologies selected for this endeavor include Angular 20 for the frontend user interface, providing a responsive and modern web experience. 
The backend logic and API services are built upon the ASP.NET Core Web API framework, chosen for its performance, scalability, and robust ecosystem. For the crucial task of sentiment analysis, 
ML.NET is integrated, offering a powerful and native.NET machine learning capability.
